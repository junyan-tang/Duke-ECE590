For this problem, you will write 3 DFA descriptions.  

We have a program which the source code is hidden from you. This program
take in a DFA description, an input string s, and a boolean value 
(True or False) expected, and it will print if the DFA description matches
your expectation. 

example: python3 dfa_sol.pyc odd1s.dfa 11 False


GOAL:
Your goal is to write three DFA descriptions following the example given 
"odds1s.dfa" and run our hidden program "dfa_solution.pyc" on the DFA 
description and an input string s to see if your DFA description is 
correct, and it recognizes the string supposed to be in its language.

1. substring11.dfa: A DFA that recognizes the language of strings that contain substring 
11 over input alphabets ∑ = {0, 1}.

2. startAendAB.dfa: A DFA that recognizes the language of strings which starts with an a 
and ends with ab over Σ = {a, b}.

3. lenMod3.dfa: A DFA that recognizes the language of strings in which the length is 
divisible by 3 with remainder 1 over input alphabets ∑ = {0, 1}.

Note First draw the DFA on paper, then translate it to the given format.

For this assignment, you will turn in the DFA descriptions (substring11.dfa, startAendAB.dfa, and lenMod3.dfa).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Examining the provided DFA: Look in odd1s.dfa. This file is a
DFA description, which recognizes the language of strings that have 
only 0s and 1s, and where the number of 1s in the string is odd. The
first line names the accepting states. In this case, just state 1. 

The following lines in the odd1s.dfa file describes the transitions. Each 
one starts by specifying what state it is describing (0: means “from
state 0...”). Then, it has an input symbol and the state number 
(symbol=state). So the line for state 0 (0:1=1,0=0) says that if you 
see a ’1’, go to state 1, and if you see a ’0’, go to state 0. The following
line (1:1=0,0=1) says that if you are in state 1 and you see a ’1’, 
go to state 0, and if you see a ’0’ go to state 1.
